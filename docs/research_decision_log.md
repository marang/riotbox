# Riotbox Research and Decision Log

Version: 0.1  
Status: Draft  
Audience: whole project

---

## 1. Purpose

This log exists to prevent repeated discussion, hidden assumptions, and undocumented architecture drift.

Use it for:

- bounded research spikes
- architecture decisions
- provider choices
- benchmark interpretations
- explicit rejections of alternatives

Do **not** use it as a diary.

## 3. Initial Entries

### RBX-001

Date: 2026-04-12  
Topic: language and documentation baseline  
Phase: Phase 0  
Question: what should be considered canonical planning documentation?  
Decision: `docs/` holds implementation-facing specs; `plan/` holds strategy and long-form planning; the active feral addendum is `plan/riotbox_liam_howlett_feral_addendum.md`.  
Why: this keeps strategy, archive history, and implementation contracts separated.  
Consequences: future spec work should land in `docs/`, not in new planning sprawl under `plan/`.  
Status: accepted

### RBX-002

Date: 2026-04-12  
Topic: MVP scope framing  
Phase: Phase 0  
Question: what is the MVP proving?  
Decision: the MVP proves the track-to-instrument path, not full generative autonomy and not DAW completeness.  
Why: this aligns engineering effort with the product spine and protects against scope drift.  
Consequences: Ghost `perform`, advanced export polish, and advanced DSP remain off the early critical path.  
Status: accepted

### RBX-003

Date: 2026-04-12  
Topic: feral mode architecture  
Phase: Phase 0  
Question: how should the feral logic live in the system?  
Decision: feral behavior must be implemented as profile / policy / scoring extensions on top of the core system, not as a second architecture.  
Why: this preserves mergeability, replay consistency, and scope discipline.  
Consequences: new feral work should land in existing modules and specs, not in parallel engines or formats.  
Status: accepted

### RBX-004

Date: 2026-04-12  
Topic: stack freeze v1  
Phase: Phase 0  
Question: which stack decisions need to be frozen before the first implementation slice begins?  
Decision: use `Rust` for the core workspace and runtime-facing model layer, keep `Python` reserved for the later analysis sidecar, target `JSON` for early persisted artifacts, and plan around `cpal`, `tokio`, and `ratatui` for the first runtime-capable stack.  
Why: this is the best fit for realtime control, deterministic state, terminal-native UX, and a later MIR sidecar without forcing premature framework commitments.  
Consequences: the first code slice starts as a Rust workspace, while transport and audio choices get validated by bounded spikes rather than more abstract debate.  
Status: accepted

## 4. Mandatory Research Topics

The following topics require explicit entries before related implementation scales:

- audio backend and latency baseline
- sidecar transport choice
- deterministic replay model
- analysis provider baseline
- benchmark threshold policy
- Ghost budget and safety policy

---

## 5. Decision Hygiene

Every major decision should record:

- what problem it solved
- what alternative was rejected
- what evidence supported it
- what follow-up work it created

If that is not written down, the decision is not stable enough to rely on.
